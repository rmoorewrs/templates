# App Templates

This is a fork of the official portainer.io application templates (**'Apps Templates'**) definitions for portainer.that has been combined with SelfHostedPro's original list (now hosted at https://github.com/Qballjos/portainer_templates). Along with others that I'll be adding myself, like gitea.

Documentation is available [on the portainer.io website](https://www.portainer.io/documentation/how-to-use-templates/) for more information about the template definition format and how to deploy your own templates.
